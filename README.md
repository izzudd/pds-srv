# PDS Server (Archived)

I made this project way back when I was still in high school. It was used as a server for the student council election app. I made it with Golang and didn't really think about security too much, 'cause you know, back then I didn't know that was a thing â€” lol.

Even so, this apps manage to get 99% valid vote from nearly 300 students, with just 2 vote not inputted properly, maybe becasue of race condition or something, idk.

Let say this is a sweet memory of my learning progress.
